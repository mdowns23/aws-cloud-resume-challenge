This is my attempt at completing the Cloud Resume Challenge using AWS <br />

The skills used in this project were HTML and CSS for building my resume. I then used an S3 bucket to store and host my static website. I got my custom domain through Route53 and secured it with HTTPS using CloudFront and ACM. 
I then built a page viewer count using AWS Lambda function, IAM roles, and DynamoDB for storage.
Finally I built the infrastructure for the viewer counter using terraform and created CICD pipelines using Github Actions.
