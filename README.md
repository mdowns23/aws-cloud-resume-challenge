This is my attemtp at creating at completing the Cloud Resume Challenge using AWS

The skills used in this project were HTML and CSS for building my resume. I then used an S3 bucket to store and host my static website. I got my custom domain through Route53 and secured it with HTTPS using CloudFront and ACM. 
I then built a page viewer count using AWS Lambda function and DynamoDB for storage.
Finally I built the infrastructure for the viewer counter using terraform.
